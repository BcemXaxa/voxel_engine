## What is it?

It is a ~~difficult as hell~~ *simple* project that I've decided to make instead of writing *CPU* 3d-renderer on *Java*
(I hate java and I don't like the idea of using CPU for rendering as it is not designed for such tasks)

## Why voxel engine?

I was inspired by some youtube videos where cool programmers showed off their fancy voxel engines or even games.
That made me wonder if I could pull off something like this or not.

## Why rust and vulkan?

My previous experience with Java, C++ and some other languages made me think of something brand new as I saw those languages outdated and inconvenient.
What could fit my purposes was Rust. Performance and new features, you know. By now I consider Rust as the best language I've ever programmed with.
As for vulkan, it was new to me too. I used OpenGL before, but it wasn't as clear what was going on behind the scenes and how to properly use it.
So I decided to try more complex alternative to figure out all the in-depth details. I think it was worth it.

## The future of the project?

Honestly, I don't know. Maybe I will develop it into some kind of game. Or maybe it will stay uncooked forever.
